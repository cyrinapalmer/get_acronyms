User Datagram Protocol
- core members of the Internet protocol suite
- suitable for purposes where error checking and correction are either not necessary or are performed in the application
- time-sensitive applications often use UDP because dropping packets is preferable to waiting for packets delayed due to retransmission, which may not be an option in a real-time system.

UEFI
Unified Extensible Firmware Interface
- replaces the Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) firmware interface originally present in all IBM PC-compatible personal computers, with most UEFI firmware implementations providing legacy support for BIOS services.
- can support remote diagnostics and repair of computers, even with no operating system installed.

UI
User Interface
- the industrial design field of human–computer interaction, is the space where interactions between humans and machines occur.

ULA
Unique Local Address
- an Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) address in the address range fc00::/7. Its purpose in IPv6 is analogous to IPv4 addressing in private networks.
- unique local addresses may be used freely, without centralized registration, inside a single site or organization or spanning a limited number of sites or organizations.
- they are routable only within the scope of such private networks, but not in the global IPv6 Internet.

UNC
Universal Naming Convention
- specifies a common syntax to describe the location of a network resource, such as a shared file, directory, or printer. The UNC syntax for Windows systems has the generic form: \\ComputerName\SharedFolder\Resource.

UPS
Uninterruptible Power Supply
- an electrical apparatus that provides emergency power to a load when the input power source or mains power fails.
- differs from an auxiliary or emergency power system or standby generator in that it will provide near-instantaneous protection from input power interruptions, by supplying energy stored in batteries, supercapacitors, or flywheels.

URL
Uniform Resource Locator
- a reference to a web resource that specifies its location on a computer network and a mechanism for retrieving it.

USB
Universal Serial Bus
- an industry standard that establishes specifications for cables, connectors and protocols for connection, communication and power supply between personal computers and their peripheral devices.

USMT
User State Migration Tool
- a command line utility program developed by Microsoft that allows users comfortable with scripting languages to transfer files and settings between Windows PCs.

UTP
Unshielded Twisted Pair
- a type of wiring in which two conductors of a single circuit are twisted together for the purposes of improving electromagnetic compatibility.

VGA
Video Graphics Array
- a graphics standard for video display controller.
- analog interface is used for high-definition video, including resolutions of 1080p and higher

VLAN
Virtual Local Area Network
- a group of devices on one or more LANs that are configured to communicate as if they were attached to the same wire, when in fact they are located on a number of different LAN segments.
- because VLANs are based on logical instead of physical connections, they are extremely flexible.

VM
Virtual Machine
- an operating system (OS) or application environment that is installed on software, which imitates dedicated hardware.

VPN
Virtual Private Network
- extends a private network across a public network, and enables users to send and receive data across shared or public networks as if their computing devices were directly connected to the private network.
- applications running across a VPN may therefore benefit from the functionality, security, and management of the private network.

VR
Virtual Reality
- a computer technology that simulates an environment with which a user may interact.

WAN
Wide-Area Network
- any telecommunications network or computer network that extends over a large geographical distance/place.
- Wide-area networks are often established with leased telecommunication circuits.

WAP
Wireless Access Point
- a networking hardware device that allows other Wi-Fi devices to connect to a wired network.

WDS
Windows Deployment Services
- a server technology from Microsoft for network-based installation of Windows operating systems.

WEP
Wired Equivalent Privacy
- a security algorithm for IEEE 802.11 wireless networks.
- superseded by Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA)

WINS
Windows Internet Name Service
- Microsoft's implementation of NetBIOS Name Service (NBNS), a name server and service for NetBIOS computer names.
- effectively, WINS is to NetBIOS names what DNS is to domain names — a central mapping of host names to network addresses.

WLAN
Wireless LAN
- a wireless computer network that links two or more devices using wireless communication to form a local area network (LAN) within a limited area such as a home, school, computer laboratory, campus, office building etc.

WPA
Wi-Fi Protected Access
- security protocols and security certification programs developed by the Wi-Fi Alliance to secure wireless computer networks.

WPS
Wi-Fi Protected Setup
- a network security standard to create a secure wireless home network.

WSUS
Windows Server Update Services
- a computer program developed by Microsoft Corporation that enables administrators to manage the distribution of updates and hotfixes released for Microsoft products to computers in a corporate environment.

XML
Extensible Markup Language
- a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable.

ZIF
Zero Insertion Force
- a type of IC socket or electrical connector that requires very little force for insertion.
